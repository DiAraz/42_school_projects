The 42 project Born2beroot gives us the opportunity to learn more about system administration. The subject requires install and configure a virtual machine. We also learn about disk partitioning, LVM (Logical Volume Manager), firewalls and password policies, SSH protocols, managing groups and using of sudo. With bonus objectives we can also learn about Lighttpd, WordPress and databases(MariaDB).

## Requirements
* Oracle VirtualBox
* Debian
* About 30Gb disk space
